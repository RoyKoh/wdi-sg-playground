I thought of replicating the user experience of a Primary 6 student taking the examination through an app where students will be quizzed on a series of practice either as a single user mode or through dual-users mode in a interactive game-like mode, if permitted multi-users realtime online.

This is a quiz trivia style mcq or fill in the blanks game for single or double player to pit their skills, possibly even online if can be done, the material taken from primary school current syllabus 10 year series, for students to practise on.

Features music on click or embedded midi/mp3.
Possibly weave some animations included.

Option for One Player or Two Player Game
