  var host = server.address().address
//define host server address, since it is (), does it refer to localhost by default? url 168.192.1.1
  var port = server.address().port
//define host server port, arbitrarily provided.

//This js passed the test but when i tried through browser localhost:port number the js
//should serve me the index.html but did not, is there any error in the codes?
